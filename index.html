                <p>My name is Mrinalini Mukherjee, I am 11 years old and study in the 6th standard. I started reading books when i was around 5-6 years old. I like to read adventure/mystery books because i think they are interesting like The adventure series by enid blyton and the nancy drew series by Carolyn Keene. My favourite authors are enid blyton and Carolyn Keene of course. I usually read books online because i dont have them on hand like ever.
